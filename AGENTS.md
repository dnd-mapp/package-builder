# Agent instructions

## Writing style

- Never hard wrap prose. Write each paragraph or list item on a single line and let the editor wrap it.
- Use US spelling only, for example "color", "behavior", and "initialize".
- Keep every sentence at or under 40 words.
- Pretty print Markdown tables so the columns line up in the source.
- Give every separator line alignment markers (`:---`, `:---:`, or `---:`).
- Carry the separator line from edge to edge of each column, with no spaces between the pipes and the dashes.

Example:

| Option   | Default  | Description               |
|:---------|:---------|:--------------------------|
| `strict` | `true`   | Enables all strict checks |
| `target` | `es2025` | Emitted language version  |

After creating or updating a file that contains prose, including Markdown files, do reading passes over it until every rule above is satisfied. Fix any violation you find, then read the file again.
